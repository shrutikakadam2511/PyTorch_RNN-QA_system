🧠 Question Answering System using RNN in PyTorch
This project implements a simple Question-Answering (QA) system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with PyTorch. The model is trained to understand and respond to questions based on given input data, demonstrating how sequence-to-sequence models can be applied in basic natural language processing tasks.

📚 Dataset
You can use:

A custom question-answer pair dataset (in CSV/JSON format)

Or synthetic QA datasets like SQuAD (for advanced setups)

For demo purposes, a toy dataset of simple Q&A pairs is provided

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3

PyTorch

NLTK / spaCy (for tokenization)

TorchText (optional)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🛠️ Features
Data preprocessing and vocabulary building

Sequence tokenization and padding

Word embedding using nn.Embedding

RNN-based encoder-decoder model

Training loop with teacher forcing

Inference mode with greedy decoding

🧠 Model Architecture
Encoder: RNN that processes the input question word-by-word and encodes it into a hidden state.

Decoder: RNN that takes the encoder’s hidden state and generates the answer sequence word-by-word.

Loss: nn.CrossEntropyLoss

Optimizer: torch.optim.Adam
